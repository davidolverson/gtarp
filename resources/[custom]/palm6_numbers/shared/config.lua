-- palm6_numbers/shared/config.lua — engine-agnostic tunables (Tier 1, carries
-- to VI). Only Bookie.coords is a Tier 3 Los Santos value.
--
-- DESIGN INTENT — the neighbourhood numbers racket. You stake CLEAN cash on a
-- two-digit number (00-99) with a back-alley bookie; every DrawIntervalSec the
-- house draws a winning number and pays hits a fixed multiple of their stake —
-- but the winnings come out DIRTY (`black_money`), so a win still has to be
-- run through palm6_laundering before it spends clean. The stake is the sink;
-- the payout multiple is deliberately below true odds (a house edge), so this
-- is a money sink over time, never a printer.
--
-- NOT palm6_fightclub. Fightclub is PARIMUTUEL wagering on a live PvP fight's
-- outcome (bettors split a pool by picking the real winner). This is a
-- FIXED-ODDS random draw against a staked number (house picks a number, pays a
-- set multiple). Different mechanic, different lane — kept distinct on purpose.
--
-- Winnings pay in `black_money` (ox_inventory stock "Dirty Money", plain
-- count == dollars — the same item qbx_bankrobbery pays and palm6_laundering
-- washes). NEVER counterfeit_cash (fake money, palm6_counterfeit's lane) and
-- NEVER markedbills (not a registered item on this server).

-- Strawberry) — verify/retune in-game.
