-- gtarp_replay/shared/config.lua — engine-agnostic tunables (Tier 1, carries to VI).
--
-- The city black-box. Every client keeps a rolling 90-second telemetry ring
-- (4 Hz compact frames — position, heading, speed, weapon, stance flags).
-- When an incident fires server-side (shots, downed player, robbery), the
-- server pulls the rings of everyone in radius and persists a scene snippet.
-- Detectives stand at the scene and replay it as translucent ghost peds.
--
-- Telemetry-only by design: NO Rockstar Editor, NO recording natives, NO
-- video/clips (qbx_smallresources already owns /record — see README).
