-- ============================================================================
-- gtarp_smuggling/shared/config.lua — engine-agnostic tunables (Tier 1).
-- Only Pickup/Dropoffs coords are Tier 3 Los Santos values.
--
-- DESIGN INTENT — standalone multi-modal contraband smuggling runs. Grab a
-- shipment at a hidden pickup, run it across the map to an assigned drop under a
-- deadline while police (who get a dispatch ping) try to intercept, and get paid
-- DIRTY (black_money). The drop's MODE (land / sea / air) sets the risk and the
-- pay — an airfield run pays far more than a roadside drop because it needs a
-- plane and a longer exposed leg.
--
-- DELIBERATELY DISTINCT from qbx_drugs deliveries (which also does timed
-- transport). The distinctness contract, honoured here:
--   1. NO dealer coupling — a standalone hidden pickup, no door-knock, no
--      dealer-rep progression.
--   2. Pays black_money (NOT markedbills, qbx_drugs' item) — so proceeds
--      launder through gtarp_laundering and are seizable by gtarp_seizure.
--   3. MULTI-MODAL drops (land/sea/air vehicle classes) — qbx_drugs is a plain
--      ground drop; the mode split is the mechanical differentiator.
--   4. Generic "shipment" concept, NOT weed_brick/coke_brick — no overlap with
--      qbx_drugs' item set (and no new ox item to register: the run is
--      server-tracked state, not a carried item).
--   5. Real dispatch + a gtarp_evidence trail, not qbx_drugs' random ping.
