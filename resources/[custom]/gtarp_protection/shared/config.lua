-- ============================================================================
-- gtarp_protection/shared/config.lua — engine-agnostic tunables (Tier 1).
-- Only Businesses[].coords are Tier 3 Los Santos values.
--
-- DESIGN INTENT — turf finally pays. gtarp_turf ships zone control as PURE
-- REPUTATION; its own README defers "material reward for holding turf" to v2.
-- This resource IS that v2 layer: a gang that controls a turf zone can lean on
-- the businesses inside it for protection money. Lose the turf, lose the
-- income — so holding ground becomes economically real for the first time.
--
-- Protection money is DIRTY (`black_money`) — it's a shakedown, not a
-- paycheck — so it feeds gtarp_laundering the same way gtarp_numbers winnings
-- do. NEVER counterfeit_cash (gtarp_counterfeit's fake-money lane), NEVER the
-- unregistered markedbills.
--
-- Turf ownership is read live from the gtarp_turf table via the established
-- soft cross-read (Bridge.GetZoneOwner) — gtarp_turf is a SOFT dependency; if
-- it isn't running, no zone has an owner and nothing can be collected.
