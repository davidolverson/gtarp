-- budget. Exceeding the budget drops the event AND increments the

-- KickThreshold breaches in a single session.

-- Only list events some resource actually registers as NET events

-- nothing net-registers can never fire and its budget is dead weight.
-- The legacy qb-core names (QBCore:Server:UpdateMoney / SetMetaData /
-- OnJobUpdate) were removed 2026-07-03: Qbox never registers them as net
-- events (money is server-authoritative via qbx_core AddMoney/RemoveMoney;
-- OnJobUpdate is an internal TriggerEvent), so those guards were inert
-- since they shipped.
