-- Per-event ratelimits. Every guarded event has a (calls, window_seconds)
-- budget. Exceeding the budget drops the event AND increments the

-- KickThreshold breaches in a single session.

-- Only list events some resource actually registers as NET events
-- (RegisterNetEvent) — the guard hooks with AddEventHandler, so a name
-- nothing net-registers can never fire and its budget is dead weight.
-- The legacy qb-core names (QBCore:Server:UpdateMoney / SetMetaData /
-- OnJobUpdate) were removed 2026-07-03: Qbox never registers them as net
-- events (money is server-authoritative via qbx_core AddMoney/RemoveMoney;
-- OnJobUpdate is an internal TriggerEvent), so those guards were inert
-- since they shipped.

    -- (client-side Game.OnPlayerLoaded) but is a bare client-addressable
    -- net event with NO in-resource rate limit (unlike acceptRules, which
    -- has its own Config.AcceptCooldownSec on top of this). It does a real
    -- DB read every call. Found during the independent harden pass on

    -- fired-weapon serials against its black-market sales registry. The
    -- handler only writes to gtarp_evidence on a real serial match (a cheap
    -- read-only lookup otherwise), same "blunt budget as defense-in-depth"
    -- reasoning as ox_inventory:openInventory above — normal gunfire can
    -- legitimately fire this often, so the budget is sized generously.
