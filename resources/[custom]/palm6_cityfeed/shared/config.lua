-- palm6_cityfeed/shared/config.lua — engine-agnostic tunables (Tier 1,
-- carries to VI).
--
-- This is the CIVIC feed: the game POSTs a small, public-facts-only event to
-- palm6-bot's /webhooks/game-event and the BOT narrates it into an in-world
-- bulletin channel (pbpd-bulletin, palm-medical-ems, doj-notices, ...) in the
-- Palm6 voice. The bot owns the embed, the routing, and a hard PII sanitizer,
-- so this resource only ships a tiny structured payload — never a raw id.
--
-- This is the SYNC-ARCHITECTURE section 5 "third leg" (game -> Discord). It is
-- distinct from palm6_discord, which posts formatted embeds straight to Discord
-- webhook URLs for the custom-feature feeds (drops/market/live/police/heat).
--
-- Auth: the FiveM Lua runtime has no native crypto, so we authenticate with a
-- shared bearer token (Authorization: Bearer <secret>) rather than an HMAC.
-- The bot validates the schema and runs the sanitizer regardless, so the token
-- is the access gate, not the integrity check.
--
-- Both convars are UNSET in the repo. Set them in the DEPLOYED server.cfg (or
-- txAdmin convars), never here — the secret must not live in git. Unset URL or
-- secret = the feed is off, and the boot banner says so in one line.

-- Delivery pacing. One POST per drain tick keeps a burst well under any rate
-- limit; the bot ALSO dedups per key and burst-caps per channel, so this is a

-- detailed "LSPD Case Desk" webhook post. Turn off here if the two read as
-- redundant for your community.
