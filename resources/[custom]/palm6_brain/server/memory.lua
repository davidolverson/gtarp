-- ============================================================================
-- palm6_brain/server/memory.lua — Phase 3: NPC MEMORY (in-memory, dark-safe).
--
-- Makes the world feel CONTINUOUS ("the dealer remembered me"). It attaches to
-- the Director's Phase-3 extension seam (server/director.lua) WITHOUT editing the
-- core, and does exactly two things, both side-effect-free:
--
--   1. OBSERVE — via Director.OnAction, every COMMITTED goal flows here. We record
--      the NOTABLE ones (agent interactions, especially anything touching the
--      literal 'player') into a small, BOUNDED store: a per-subject ring (last
--      ~N events for each npc id AND for 'player') plus a bounded global recent
--      list. NOTHING here yields (no Wait/HTTP) — the seam contract requires
--      observers to be cheap, and a broken observer is already pcall-isolated by
--      the Director, so we also never throw on bad input.
--
--   2. TEACH — via Director.RegisterContext, each tick we hand the Director a
--      SHORT natural-language digest of the most recent notable events
--      ("Recently: mover_legion_1 spoke with a player; mover_pier_1 was seen
--      dealing.") so the next plan can honour continuity. The digest is length-
--      and item-capped so it can never bloat the prompt.
--
-- 🔒 WHY THIS IS SAFE TO ALWAYS RUN: memory has ZERO gameplay side effects — it
-- only reads committed actions and appends prompt text. It cannot move a ped,
-- money, or dispatch. Even so it is gated behind the local ENABLED flag below so
-- it can be killed instantly, and it registers NOTHING (and defines no store) if
-- Config or the Director seam is missing. Load order: this file MUST come AFTER
-- server/director.lua in fxmanifest's server_scripts (the seam it hooks is
-- defined there). If Director is nil we no-op cleanly.
--
-- 📌 PERSISTENCE IS OUT OF SCOPE FOR v1 (in-memory only). Everything is dropped on
-- resource restart. A future slice can add a DB/file hook: serialise `recent`
-- (and optionally the per-subject rings) on onResourceStop and rehydrate on start
-- — see the persistence hook comment near the bottom. Kept out now to ship the
-- observe→teach loop before taking on storage/GDPR-shaped questions.
