-- PHASE 0 of the AI-NPC living world (docs/AI-NPC-ROADMAP.md): curated AMBIENT
-- life, ZERO AI. Client-side, non-networked peds that populate hand-picked spots
-- so a low-population server doesn't feel dead. No economy, no dialogue, no LLM —
-- this is the substrate the later Director tier will steer.
--
-- WHY CLIENT-SIDE LOCAL PEDS: for pure ambience the research is unambiguous —
-- local (non-networked) peds cost nothing on the network, sidestep OneSync
-- ownership-migration jank entirely, and each client simply populates around
-- itself (exactly how GTA's own ambient population works). Server orchestration
-- only becomes necessary in Phase 2 (economy — a customer walking into a business
-- and paying it real money), and is deliberately NOT here yet.

-- *** ENABLED 2026-07-22 for the first AI-NPC feel-test: ambient life at 3 plazas
-- + 3 GLM-powered named NPCs (Big Tony/Rosa/Deak) at Legion Square. GLM convars
-- (palm6:glm_*) are set on the box; NPCs use canned lines if GLM ever fails.

--
-- 🔶 COORDS ARE GROUND-SNAPPED at spawn (GetGroundZFor_3dCoord), so the z only has
-- to be roughly right — a ped lands on the actual ground, not floating. x/y still

-- block below); the examples are well-known plazas but VERIFY each in-game and
-- delete any that land somewhere wrong.

-- PHASE 1 — NAMED NPCs you can TALK to (docs/AI-NPC-ROADMAP.md).
-- Each is a persistent character with an identity card. Right now the reply

-- path — client target -> server -> client bubble — so the whole conversation
-- loop is testable now, and swapping in the LLM later is a server-only change
-- (replace the stub in server/main.lua with an HTTP call to the `cortex` sidecar;
-- the identity card + memory become the model's context). Nothing here spawns
-- while Config.Enabled is false.
--
-- `id`     stable key (memory/relationships hang off this later).
-- `role`/`personality` become the LLM system prompt in Phase 1-real.
-- `lines`  stub responses until the brain is wired.

-- ===========================================================================
-- PHASE 2b — THE AI DIRECTOR (docs/AI-NPC-ROADMAP.md §Phase 2).
--
-- The Director is a low-frequency, BATCHED, server-side LLM call: once per tick
-- it looks at the whole NPC roster + world state and assigns each NPC ONE goal
-- from a CLOSED action enum. The model only ever picks a verb + typed args; the
-- Lua engine chooses whether/how to act. This is the "on-rails AI" the roadmap
-- describes: the LLM literally cannot name an action or target we didn't define,
-- because every returned action passes three validation layers
-- (shape → referential → legality) before anything happens.
--
-- 🔒 SAFETY MODEL — why this ships DARK and in DRY-RUN:
--   • Config.Director.Enabled = false  → the tick never runs (prod-inert).
--   • Config.Director.DryRun  = true   → even when the tick runs, accepted
--       actions are only LOGGED ("Tony WOULD goTo the plaza"), never executed.
--   • Config.Director.MoneyEnabled / CrimeEnabled = false → the money and crime
--       verbs still VALIDATE, but the legality layer BLOCKS them, so they can
--       never fire even if DryRun were off. These are the two capability gates
--       that guard the live economy and the police-dispatch bus. They are the
--       flips that require David's browser-walk (money) / rate-limit review
--       (crime) FIRST — see the roadmap's "Risks & hard parts".
--
-- Nothing in this block spawns a ped, moves money, or calls dispatch. It is the
-- planning spine only. Actuation (networked peds, palm6_business income,
-- Bridge.AlertPolice) lands in later, individually-gated slices.
-- ===========================================================================
Config.Director = {

    -- DRY-RUN. true = accepted actions are only LOGGED and discarded (the tick
    -- proves the LLM→validate pipeline with zero state change). false = accepted
    -- actions are COMMITTED to the server-side goal store with a TTL and
    -- broadcast to clients on `palm6_brain:goal` (npcId, goal|false) — the seam
    -- the ped-actuation slice subscribes to. NOTE: even with DryRun=false there
    -- is still NO ped movement, money, or dispatch until the client executor and
    -- the Money/Crime gates land; a committed goal with no consumer is inert.

    DryRun = true,

    -- Goal Time-To-Live = TickSeconds * this. A committed goal auto-expires after
    -- this many ticks with no refresh, so a Director outage (GLM down) can never

    -- always-on Lua reflex tier (the roadmap's graceful-degradation guarantee).

    --       ⚠️ palm6_business enforces exactly ONE bounded NPC-income faucet
    --       (owner-present, supply-gated, daily-capped). Auto-crediting an
    --       ABSENT owner would be a NEW faucet = AFK money-printer. Do NOT flip
    --       this until the economy model for off-peak income is decided and the
    --       money path is browser-walked (roadmap "Economy safety").
    --   CrimeEnabled → verbs that would call the police-dispatch bus
    --       (rob, attack, deal). Gate off until rate-limits + CountOnDutyPolice
    --       gating are wired so off-peak crime can't spam on-duty officers.
