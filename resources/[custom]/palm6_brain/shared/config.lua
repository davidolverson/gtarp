-- PHASE 0 of the AI-NPC living world (docs/AI-NPC-ROADMAP.md): curated AMBIENT
-- life, ZERO AI. Client-side, non-networked peds that populate hand-picked spots
-- so a low-population server doesn't feel dead. No economy, no dialogue, no LLM —
-- this is the substrate the later Director tier will steer.
--
-- WHY CLIENT-SIDE LOCAL PEDS: for pure ambience the research is unambiguous —
-- local (non-networked) peds cost nothing on the network, sidestep OneSync
-- ownership-migration jank entirely, and each client simply populates around
-- itself (exactly how GTA's own ambient population works). Server orchestration
-- only becomes necessary in Phase 2 (economy — a customer walking into a business
-- and paying it real money), and is deliberately NOT here yet.

-- exhaustion, which would cause spawn failures elsewhere.

-- If true, spawned peds react to danger (flee gunfire, dodge cars) instead of
-- standing frozen on their scenario — reads as more alive. If false, they stay

-- set its own `models` draws random models from here.

-- SCENES — hand-picked spots that get extra ambient life on top of GTA's default
-- population. Each is an anchor {x,y,z} plus how many peds and the radius they
-- scatter within. Per-scene `models` / `scenarios` override the pools above.
--
-- 🔶 COORDS ARE GROUND-SNAPPED at spawn (GetGroundZFor_3dCoord), so the z only has
-- to be roughly right — a ped lands on the actual ground, not floating. x/y still
-- matter. Capture a fresh spot in-game with /brainscene (prints a paste-ready
-- block below); the examples are well-known plazas but VERIFY each in-game and
-- delete any that land somewhere wrong.
