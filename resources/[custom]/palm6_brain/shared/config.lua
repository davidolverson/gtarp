-- PHASE 0 of the AI-NPC living world (docs/AI-NPC-ROADMAP.md): curated AMBIENT
-- life, ZERO AI. Client-side, non-networked peds that populate hand-picked spots
-- so a low-population server doesn't feel dead. No economy, no dialogue, no LLM —
-- this is the substrate the later Director tier will steer.
--
-- WHY CLIENT-SIDE LOCAL PEDS: for pure ambience the research is unambiguous —
-- local (non-networked) peds cost nothing on the network, sidestep OneSync
-- ownership-migration jank entirely, and each client simply populates around
-- itself (exactly how GTA's own ambient population works). Server orchestration
-- only becomes necessary in Phase 2 (economy — a customer walking into a business
-- and paying it real money), and is deliberately NOT here yet.

-- MASTER GATE. false = prod-inert: the spawn loop returns immediately, no ped is
-- ever created. Flip true (+ redeploy) for a feel-test. Mirrors the dark-ship
-- idiom used across palm6_* resources.
-- *** ENABLED 2026-07-22 for the first AI-NPC feel-test: ambient life at 3 plazas
-- + 3 GLM-powered named NPCs (Big Tony/Rosa/Deak) at Legion Square. GLM convars
-- (palm6:glm_*) are set on the box; NPCs use canned lines if GLM ever fails.
-- Rollback = set false + redeploy. Coords are ground-snapped but tune in-game. ***

-- If true, spawned peds react to danger (flee gunfire, dodge cars) instead of
-- standing frozen on their scenario — reads as more alive. If false, they stay

-- population. Each is an anchor {x,y,z} plus how many peds and the radius they
-- scatter within. Per-scene `models` / `scenarios` override the pools above.
--
-- 🔶 COORDS ARE GROUND-SNAPPED at spawn (GetGroundZFor_3dCoord), so the z only has
-- to be roughly right — a ped lands on the actual ground, not floating. x/y still
-- matter. Capture a fresh spot in-game with /brainscene (prints a paste-ready
-- block below); the examples are well-known plazas but VERIFY each in-game and
-- delete any that land somewhere wrong.

-- PHASE 1 — NAMED NPCs you can TALK to (docs/AI-NPC-ROADMAP.md).
-- Each is a persistent character with an identity card. Right now the reply
-- comes from a STUB brain (a canned line from `lines`) travelling the REAL
-- path — client target -> server -> client bubble — so the whole conversation
-- loop is testable now, and swapping in the LLM later is a server-only change
-- (replace the stub in server/main.lua with an HTTP call to the `cortex` sidecar;
-- the identity card + memory become the model's context). Nothing here spawns
-- while Config.Enabled is false.
--
-- `id`     stable key (memory/relationships hang off this later).
-- `role`/`personality` become the LLM system prompt in Phase 1-real.
-- `lines`  stub responses until the brain is wired.
-- Coords are ground-snapped like scenes; capture with /brainscene.
