-- ============================================================================
-- palm6_discord/shared/config.lua — engine-agnostic tunables (Tier 1,
-- carries to VI). One resource owns every PLAYER-FACING Discord feed so
-- rate limiting, retries, and formatting live in exactly one place.
--
-- This is the hype/RP announcer, NOT the ops plumbing: palm6_staff's
-- private audit webhook and palm6_perf's hitch webhook stay where they are
-- (staff-only data does not belong in a resource that also posts to public
-- channels).
--
-- Each feed reads its webhook URL from a convar. Unset convar = that feed
-- is off; the boot banner names which feeds are live so a misconfigured
-- deploy is visible in one console line. Producers (flashdrop, pumpcoin,
-- clout, evidence, counterfeit) call exports.palm6_discord:Announce(...)
-- through a soft-dependency guard, so this resource being absent or a feed
-- being off never breaks gameplay.
