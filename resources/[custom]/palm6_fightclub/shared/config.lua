-- ============================================================================
-- palm6_fightclub/shared/config.lua — engine-agnostic tunables (Tier 1,
-- carries to VI). An underground bare-knuckle ring: two citizens queue up
-- at the ring, a match opens a betting window, spectators wager cash on
-- either fighter, then the fight runs unarmed and server-monitored until a
-- knockout, a forfeit (leaving the ring / drawing a weapon / disconnect),
-- or a timeout draw. Payouts are a parimutuel pool split among winning
-- bettors, minus a house rake, plus a purse cut straight to the winner.
