-- ============================================================================
-- palm6_bounty/shared/config.lua — engine-agnostic tunables (Tier 1, carries
-- to VI). The wanted board: the city auto-posts a state contract on every
-- citizen carrying an active `palm6_mdt_warrants` warrant (read-only —
-- this resource never writes to palm6_mdt's tables, only SELECTs them, the
-- same house pattern palm6_pumpcoin/palm6_clout/palm6_flashdrop use to read
-- palm6_turf). Any citizen can also post a private cash contract on another
-- citizen, escrowed up front. A hunter claims by actually beating the
-- target down and getting close enough to slap the cuffs on — a name+amount
-- board, not a GPS tracker.
