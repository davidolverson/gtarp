-- Tunables for the read-only season scoreboard: ladder registry, row limits,
-- rate limits, the admin ace name, and the OFF-by-default Discord tie-in.
-- No secrets, no framework calls. server/main.lua holds the SQL keyed by the
-- same ladder names listed here, so this file is the single list a reviewer
-- reads to know exactly what boards exist.

-- Season-close prize ladder. When a season closes, the archived top finishers
-- of each ladder earn a CLAIMABLE clean-cash reward (banked on /seasonclaim,
-- so it is offline-safe and can never double-pay). Amounts are per finishing
-- position [1]=winner. Citizen ladders pay the person; gang ladders pay the

-- 'rep' is noPrize because gang rep is minted per turf-takeover and is therefore
-- farmable by two gangs trading zones; paying it a prize would turn that farm
-- into a clean-cash exploit. Turf HELD is the paying gang ladder instead — it is
-- zero-sum (one owner per zone) and contested, so it can't be co-farmed.
