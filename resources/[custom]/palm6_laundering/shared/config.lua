-- palm6_laundering/shared/config.lua — engine-agnostic tunables (Tier 1,
-- carries to VI). Only Front.coords (a Los Santos spot) is a Tier 3 value to
-- retune when the VI map lands (see docs/GTA6-TIER3-RETUNE.md).
--
-- DESIGN INTENT — the missing SINK for the crime economy's dirty cash.
-- qbx_bankrobbery pays hauls out as `black_money` (ox_inventory's stock
-- "Dirty Money" item, plain count == dollars) — a stackable item you can
-- hold and hand around but never bank or spend as clean money. Nothing in
-- the recipe or the custom layer converts it. This resource is the wash:
-- a hidden laundromat front takes `black_money`, skims a fee, and returns
-- CLEAN bank funds — with a daily ceiling, an internal heat model that can
-- summon police, and an evidence trail (palm6_evidence v2) so a laundering
-- run can become a case.
--
-- NOT counterfeit. palm6_counterfeit's `counterfeit_cash` is FAKE money that
-- gets PASSED (fenced/spent), and its own README states it "can never be
-- laundered". The two systems deliberately never interact: this resource
-- touches ONLY `black_money` and never `counterfeit_cash`.
--
-- NOTE on the item name (verified against the REAL deployed recipe, not the
-- custom layer's stale comments): the dirty-money item actually registered
-- and in circulation on this server is `black_money` (ox_inventory stock,
-- given by qbx_bankrobbery). The `markedbills` name referenced in some older
-- custom-layer comments is NOT a registered item here (qbx_storerobbery's
-- marked-bills reward no-ops, qbx_drugs runs useMarkedBills=false) — do not
-- wire against it.
