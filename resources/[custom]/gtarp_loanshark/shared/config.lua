-- ============================================================================
-- gtarp_loanshark/shared/config.lua — engine-agnostic tunables (Tier 1).
-- Only Shark.coords is a Tier 3 Los Santos value.
--
-- DESIGN INTENT — credit for criminals, and the drama of stiffing it. Borrow
-- DIRTY cash (black_money) from a back-alley shark up to a cap; owe principal
-- plus a flat interest by a deadline; repay in CLEAN bank money at the shark.
-- Miss the deadline and you DEFAULT — the shark puts a warrant on you
-- (gtarp_mdt), which gtarp_bounty then auto-posts as a hunting contract. So the
-- real play isn't the loan economics (borrowing dirty to repay clean at
-- interest is a deliberately steep sink); it's the leverage: instant dirty
-- liquidity now, or take the money and run and become a wanted target.
--
-- Principal is paid DIRTY (black_money — needs laundering to spend clean, or
-- spends directly at the recipe's BlackMarketArms). NEVER counterfeit_cash
-- (gtarp_counterfeit's lane), NEVER the unregistered markedbills.
