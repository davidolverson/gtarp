-- Pure logic: show the welcome notification once the character is loaded.
-- The framework loaded-event and the notify call go through Game.*
-- (bridge/cl_game.lua), so this file is engine-agnostic. To port to GTA VI,
-- rewrite the bridge, not this file. See docs/GTA6-READINESS.md.
--
-- The framework fires its loaded event only AFTER the player has actively
-- selected a character in the multichar UI and that character has spawned
-- (see the bridge for the framework-specific verification). Hooking it here
-- means the welcome shows once selection is complete, never before it.
