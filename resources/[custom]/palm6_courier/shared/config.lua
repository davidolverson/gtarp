-- Distance in metres at which a delivery is considered completed when
-- the courier arrives at the dropoff. Client-side detection uses this
-- directly; the server re-checks it against its OWN read of the courier's
-- position (see palm6_courier:complete) with a small extra allowance
-- below for the gap between the client's 1.5s poll and the network
-- round-trip — never the raw client claim.

-- Deliveries left in status='taken' longer than this are treated as
-- abandoned (courier disconnected, went idle, or never intended to
-- finish) and swept the same way expired 'open' postings are: bounty
-- refunded to the poster, row marked 'expired'. Without this an
-- accept-and-vanish permanently locks another player's escrowed money —
-- 'taken' rows have no other expiry path.
Config.AcceptedLifetimeMinutes = 60

-- Blip colour for accepted delivery destination on the courier's map.
