-- gtarp_robbery/shared/config.lua
--
-- ATM robberies with a police dispatch alert. Rob an ATM while armed, hold
-- through a timer, and collect cash. A dispatch pings on-duty police; a
-- minimum-cops gate is configurable.
--
-- Store/register robbery is intentionally NOT here — the recipe's own
-- `qbx_storerobbery` already does that at these exact store locations
-- (registers, safes, cameras, lockpick requirement, cop-count gate). Confirmed
-- by reading `resources/[qbx]/qbx_storerobbery` directly, not just its
-- config — see the "verify against the real deployed tree" lesson in
-- docs/DEVELOPMENT.md. An earlier draft of this resource duplicated it; that
-- half was removed before merge.
--
-- DESIGN (reward, timer, cooldown, dispatch rules) is Tier 1 and carries.
-- The ATM coords are Tier 3 (Los Santos points) — mirrored in
-- docs/GTA6-TIER3-RETUNE.md.
