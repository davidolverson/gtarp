-- palm6_business/shared/config.lua — engine-agnostic tunables.
--
-- DESIGN INTENT — the player-owned BUSINESS layer neither Qbox nor qbx_management
-- ships. qbx_management provides society bank accounts + boss menus for the
-- whitelisted JOBS (police/EMS/mechanic). It has NO concept of a civilian
-- business a player REGISTERS and RUNS: a registry, an account, employees,
-- payroll, walk-in revenue, and a ledger. That is this resource's scope, built
-- on our own tables (palm6_businesses / palm6_business_members /
-- palm6_business_ledger) — the same player-run-org shape as palm6_gangs.
--
-- MONEY SAFETY: a business is a POOLED REAL-MONEY account (like a gang vault),
-- never a printer. Money enters only via owner deposit, customer charge, and the
-- ONE capped NPC-income faucet (§ below). See docs/superpowers/specs/
-- 2026-07-20-palm6-business-design.md §2 for the full invariant list.

Config = {}

Config.Debug = false

-- MASTER GATE. false = prod-inert: commands refuse, net events early-return,
-- nothing player-facing registers. Flip true (+ redeploy) to go live, batched
-- with a feel-test. Mirrors the palm6_racing / palm6_fc_core dark-ship idiom.
-- LIVE in production (preserved across the feat->main merge; the new Phase-1 gates
-- below stay false so only the hardened Phase-0 core is active).
Config.Enabled = true

-- PHASE 1 GATE — physical storefronts (map location + blip + walk-up target;
-- proximity-gated management; storefront-anchored serving). Independent of
-- Config.Enabled so enabling Phase 0 does NOT auto-enable storefronts: BOTH must
-- be true for any storefront code path to run. Flip true (+ redeploy) only after
-- the Phase 1 feel-test. false = Phase 0 behaves exactly as it does today (a
-- business with no storefront row is indistinguishable from a Phase-0 business).
-- *** ENABLED 2026-07-21 for feel-test (gate 1 of 6, per GO-LIVE-RUNBOOK §C).
-- Rollback = set false + redeploy; storefront rows persist and simply go unused. ***
Config.Phase1Enabled = true

-- PER-TYPE MECHANICS GATE — gives each business type its own economic identity
-- (payout / supply cost / cooldown / daily cap / supply cap) and a themed serve
-- interaction (verb, nouns, skill-check), instead of all five sharing the Phase-0
-- numbers. INDEPENDENT of the storefront gate. While false, opServe/opBuyStock use
-- the GLOBAL Config values below EXACTLY as today — the LIVE Phase-0 economy is
-- byte-for-byte unchanged. Flip true (+ redeploy) only after a per-type feel-test.
-- Every serve stays bounded the same four ways (cost basis + clocked-in worker +
-- per-worker cooldown + atomic per-business daily cap); this only changes the
-- NUMBERS per type, never the invariants — no new faucet, no new exploit surface.
Config.PerTypeMechanics = false

-- MANAGER DELEGATE GATE — lets an owner promote an employee to MANAGER (role 2),
-- who can run the day-to-day (hire, fire employees, run payroll, buy supply, serve)
-- but CANNOT extract or redefine the business: withdraw, set wages, rename,
-- storefront, and promote/demote stay OWNER-only. Keeping setWage owner-only is
-- deliberate — it closes the only account-drain path a delegate could otherwise
-- abuse (inflate a wage + run payroll). INDEPENDENT gate; while false, promote/
-- demote refuse and every management op falls back to OWNER-only — byte-for-byte
-- the current behaviour (no manager has ever been assigned). Flip true (+ redeploy)
-- after a delegate feel-test.
Config.ManagerRole = false

-- Max managers an owner can appoint (excludes the owner). Bounds delegation.
Config.MaxManagers = 3

-- OWNERSHIP LIFECYCLE GATE — lets an owner TRANSFER the business to a roster member
-- (they become owner, the old owner drops to employee) or CLOSE it (remaining
-- account balance is refunded to the owner's bank, then the business + roster are
-- deleted). Fills the documented gap where an owner was stuck forever (opResign
-- refuses an owner). INDEPENDENT gate; while false the two ops refuse and the menu
-- items are hidden — no change to the live Phase-0 system. Flip true (+ redeploy)
-- after a transfer/close feel-test. Neither op can mint or overdraw: transfer moves
-- no money; close refunds the OWNER their own account via the crash-safe pending
-- idiom (drain-to-zero captured atomically) before deleting.
Config.OwnershipLifecycle = false

-- ROBBERY GATE — a non-member can crack a business's register at its storefront for
-- a CAPPED cut of the account, paid to their bank. Pure redistribution (atomic
-- guarded debit of the business account, never minted, never overdrawn), bounded by
-- a small percentage + a hard cap + a long per-business cooldown + a per-robber
-- cooldown, and it fires a police alert. Gives a placed storefront real stakes and
-- rewards owners who withdraw profits instead of hoarding. INDEPENDENT gate; while
-- false /robstore refuses and nothing changes. Requires a placed storefront (Phase 1a).

-- PHASE 1b — INTERIORS. Makes a storefront an actual PLACE you walk into,
-- instead of a blip over open street ("it's virtually there, there is no actual
-- building"). Three parts, all inert behind this gate:
--
--   1. SHELL      an existing enterable interior, reused as the room.
--   2. BUCKET     a native routing bucket per business, so every business gets
--                 a PRIVATE copy of that shell (unlimited businesses, one room).
--   3. LAYOUT     per-business prop dressing spawned on entry, so two businesses
--                 in the same shell do NOT look the same.
--
-- WHY NOT A CUSTOM MLO PER BUSINESS: a bespoke interior needs an MLO archetype
-- (rooms/portals/entity sets) plus a BINARY .ymap placement. Neither Sollumz nor
-- szio can emit a binary ymap headlessly (see fivem-asset-templates/
-- ASSET-PIPELINE.md §8) — it is a manual CodeWalker step per interior. Runtime
-- prop spawning needs NO ymap at all, so the LAYOUT tier buys per-business
-- identity with the fully-headless prop pipeline we already have.
--
-- 🔴 bob74_ipl IS NOT INSTALLED on this server (verified: absent from custom.cfg,
-- absent from server.cfg.example, zero references in docs/deploy/CI; the only
-- mentions are palm6_counterfeit treating it as optional). So the shell catalog
-- is restricted to BASE-GAME enterable interiors, which need no IPL. If bob74_ipl
-- is ever added, extra shells drop into Config.Interior.Shells with no code change.
--
-- INDEPENDENT gate. While false: no entry target, no bucket is ever assigned, no
-- prop is ever spawned, /bizshell refuses. Requires a placed storefront (Phase 1a).
-- *** ENABLED 2026-07-21 for the in-game feel-test (gate of 7, per GO-LIVE-RUNBOOK
-- §C). SAFE to ship on: the feature is INERT until an admin /bizshell-captures at
-- least one shell — no Enter option appears, no routing bucket is ever assigned,
-- and migration 0073 is additive (new table + nullable column). First in-game step
-- is capture (see docs/BUSINESS-INTERIORS-CAPTURE.md). Rollback = set false +
-- redeploy; captured shells persist and simply go unused. ***
