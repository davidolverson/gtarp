-- ============================================================================
-- palm6_business/shared/config.lua — engine-agnostic tunables.
--
-- DESIGN INTENT — the player-owned BUSINESS layer neither Qbox nor qbx_management
-- ships. qbx_management provides society bank accounts + boss menus for the
-- whitelisted JOBS (police/EMS/mechanic). It has NO concept of a civilian
-- business a player REGISTERS and RUNS: a registry, an account, employees,
-- payroll, walk-in revenue, and a ledger. That is this resource's scope, built
-- on our own tables (palm6_businesses / palm6_business_members /
-- palm6_business_ledger) — the same player-run-org shape as palm6_gangs.
--
-- MONEY SAFETY: a business is a POOLED REAL-MONEY account (like a gang vault),
-- never a printer. Money enters only via owner deposit, customer charge, and the
-- ONE capped NPC-income faucet (§ below). See docs/superpowers/specs/
-- 2026-07-20-palm6-business-design.md §2 for the full invariant list.

Config = {}

Config.Debug = false

-- MASTER GATE. false = prod-inert: commands refuse, net events early-return,
-- nothing player-facing registers. Flip true (+ redeploy) to go live, batched
-- with a feel-test. Mirrors the palm6_racing / palm6_fc_core dark-ship idiom.
Config.Enabled = false

-- PHASE 1 GATE — physical storefronts (map location + blip + walk-up target;
-- proximity-gated management; storefront-anchored serving). Independent of
-- Config.Enabled so enabling Phase 0 does NOT auto-enable storefronts: BOTH must
-- be true for any storefront code path to run. Flip true (+ redeploy) only after
-- the Phase 1 feel-test. false = Phase 0 behaves exactly as it does today (a
-- business with no storefront row is indistinguishable from a Phase-0 business).
Config.Phase1Enabled = false

-- PER-TYPE MECHANICS GATE — gives each business type its own economic identity
-- (payout / supply cost / cooldown / daily cap / supply cap) and a themed serve
-- interaction (verb, nouns, skill-check), instead of all five sharing the Phase-0
-- numbers. INDEPENDENT of the storefront gate. While false, opServe/opBuyStock use
-- the GLOBAL Config values below EXACTLY as today — the LIVE Phase-0 economy is
-- byte-for-byte unchanged. Flip true (+ redeploy) only after a per-type feel-test.
-- Every serve stays bounded the same four ways (cost basis + clocked-in worker +
-- per-worker cooldown + atomic per-business daily cap); this only changes the
-- NUMBERS per type, never the invariants — no new faucet, no new exploit surface.
Config.PerTypeMechanics = false

-- MANAGER DELEGATE GATE — lets an owner promote an employee to MANAGER (role 2),
-- who can run the day-to-day (hire, fire employees, run payroll, buy supply, serve)
-- but CANNOT extract or redefine the business: withdraw, set wages, rename,
-- storefront, and promote/demote stay OWNER-only. Keeping setWage owner-only is
-- deliberate — it closes the only account-drain path a delegate could otherwise
-- abuse (inflate a wage + run payroll). INDEPENDENT gate; while false, promote/
-- demote refuse and every management op falls back to OWNER-only — byte-for-byte
-- the current behaviour (no manager has ever been assigned). Flip true (+ redeploy)
-- after a delegate feel-test.
Config.ManagerRole = false

-- Max managers an owner can appoint (excludes the owner). Bounds delegation.
Config.MaxManagers = 3

-- Business catalog. `label` shows in the register picker + roster. `flavor` is
-- cosmetic copy. All types share the same mechanics in Phase 0 (the difference
-- is roleplay identity + future storefront/venue hooks in Phase 1). Extensible.
-- `blip` = the DEFAULT map-blip sprite for a new storefront of this type (Phase 1;
-- the owner can re-pick from Config.Storefront.Sprites). All sprite ids are
-- validated against the allowlist on write, so an unknown value here is inert.
--
-- `service` = the per-type ECONOMIC PROFILE + themed serve interaction, applied
-- only when Config.PerTypeMechanics is true (else the global Config.* values below
-- are used for every type — the live Phase-0 numbers). Each profile keeps the same
-- faucet shape, just different values: fast/cheap/high-volume (restaurant, retail)
-- vs slow/expensive/big-ticket (garage, dealership). `skill` is the ox_lib
-- skillCheck spec for that type's serve (difficulty list + input keys). Labels
-- theme the UI + notifications + ledger memo. dailyCap here overrides the per-type
-- NPC income ceiling; maxSupply the per-type storage cap.
