-- A cheap server-thread hitch sampler. Spends one thread sleeping for
-- SamplePeriodMs and comparing the wallclock delta against the expected
-- delta. Any overshoot >= HitchThresholdMs is recorded; periodic p95/p99
-- summaries are printed and (optionally) pushed to a webhook.
--
-- This resource MUST be cheap to run; it should not itself become the
-- thing it is measuring.
