-- palm6_citations/shared/config.lua — engine-agnostic tunables (Tier 1,
-- carries to VI). Citations are DEBT WITH MEMORY: the recipe's
-- police:server:BillPlayer and radar fines are instant online-and-nearby
-- debits that record nothing (a target who can't pay escapes with no
-- trace). A citation is a ledger row on the citizen — online or offline —
-- payable later at city hall, and it escalates to a palm6_mdt warrant
-- when it goes overdue. Non-payment is a story hook, not a free pass.
