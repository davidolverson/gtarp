## Register

### CD-001 — Brand art: department + state art placed; System A core mark still pending
- **Severity:** Medium · **Status:** In Progress · **Owner:** David Olverson
- **Detail:** Full keeper set pulled from the Palm6 Discord bot DMs and placed:
  **24 Palm6 department crests** (`01-BRAND/logos/departments/`) + **2 Verano state seals**
  (`01-BRAND/logos/state/`), all registered Candidate. **Still missing:** the **System A
  core identity mark** (the primary ownable Palm6/Verano logo) — a different asset class
  from the department crests and state seals.
- **Resolution:** (a) DONE — 24 departments + 2 state seals placed + registered.
  (b) OPEN — supply the System A core mark, place in `01-BRAND/logos/`, register it, and
  fill the System A specifics in `BRAND-GUIDELINES.md`. The brand half of the Phase 2 gate
  closes when the System A core mark lands.

### CD-006 — Private-business logo tier rejected, being redone
- **Severity:** Low · **Status:** In Progress · **Owner:** David Olverson
- **Detail:** The first private-business logo batch (Apex Motors, Bayside Realty, Verano
  Air, Coastline Insurance, Harbor Freight, Palm Medical, Harbor Energy, PalmLink, Palm6
  Garage, +more — the synthwave "P6" style) was rejected as too generic/"ugly". Those
  assets are deliberately **NOT** committed to the repo.
- **Resolution:** David regenerates in ChatGPT using the improved system in
  `01-BRAND/BUSINESS-BRAND-BRIEF.md` (one palette, flat vector, one type family, one icon
  each, consistent lockup). Register the approved set in the Asset Registry once done.

### CD-002 — `prop_spawn` dev resource is stopped, not removed
- **Severity:** Medium · **Status:** Accepted (for now) · **Owner:** Dev Lead
- **Detail:** `resources/[custom]/prop_spawn` is a dev-only test helper (ungated
  networked `CreateObject`). It is neutralized in production via `stop prop_spawn` in
  `custom.cfg` (execs after the panel's root server.cfg ensures it), because the panel
  server.cfg is outside this repo and cannot be edited to un-ensure it.
- **Resolution:** When panel access is available, remove the ensure from the root
  server.cfg and delete/relocate the resource. Until then the `stop` is the correct,
  documented mitigation. See `docs/RESTRUCTURING/PHASE-2-DEPRECATIONS.md`.

### CD-003 — Placeholder in-world coordinates on new NPC destinations
- **Severity:** Low · **Status:** Open · **Owner:** David Olverson (in-game feel-test)
- **Detail:** Several discoverable destinations use placeholder coords pending an
  in-game pass: lottery kiosk (near Davis 24/7), gunrunning dealer (scrapyard lot),
  fightclub ring (Vanilla Unicorn back lot — config marks it placeholder pending MLO),
  black market (Config). All are flagged VERIFY IN-GAME in their configs.
- **Resolution:** David retunes coords/headings in-game; update the resource configs.

### CD-004 — Downstream repo identities undefined (DEC-002a)
- **Severity:** Medium · **Status:** Open · **Owner:** David Olverson
- **Detail:** Canonical remotes confirmed for Main Server (`BlacklineDevs/gtarp`) and
  Discord Bot (`BlacklineDevs/palm6-bot`). The **Website** and **Commercial Scripts**
  canonical repos are still undeclared (DEC-002a). Does not block gtarp Phase 2/3; does
  block starting the Website repo.
- **Resolution:** David declares the two remotes; log the ruling as a Decision Log entry.

### CD-005 — Creative System is Candidate in gtarp (Phase 0 not run)
- **Severity:** Medium · **Status:** Accepted · **Owner:** David Olverson (Project Lead)
- **Detail:** gtarp adopted the Creative System as Candidate (v0.9.0-rc.1) per DEC-001.
  Phase 0 (the project-level Approval Gate that promotes the system to v1.0.0) has not
  run. Phase 2's entry condition is only "Phase 1 complete," so Phase 2 proceeds under
  the Candidate system; Phase 3 (Alignment) should run against an Approved system.
- **Resolution:** Run Phase 0 (Foundation Review + promotion) before gtarp Phase 3.
  See `14-OPERATIONS/README.md` for the DEC-numbering reconciliation.
