# Decision Log Entry Template

**Version:** v0.9.0-rc.1 (Release Candidate)
**Status:** Release Candidate, Ready for Execution
**Owner:** Palm6 Creative System

---

## Purpose

This is the canonical copy-paste template for a single Decision Log entry. Its fields and ordering match `00-FOUNDATION/09-DECISION-LOG.md` exactly. Use it any time a decision needs to be recorded so that the log stays consistent and machine-readable over time.

The governing rule of the Creative System is preserved here: nothing is "Approved" without a corresponding Decision Log entry. If a decision is not written down, it did not happen.

---

## Usage Note

1. Copy the block under "Template" below.
2. Paste it as a new entry into `00-FOUNDATION/09-DECISION-LOG.md`, in chronological order, beneath the most recent entry.
3. Fill every field. Do not leave a field blank. If a field does not apply, write "None" so the omission is intentional and visible.
4. Assign the next sequential Decision ID. DEC-001 (Dual Visual System) is already recorded as Approved. DEC-002 (promotion of the Creative System from v0.9.0-rc.1 to v1.0.0) is created during Phase 0, the Creative System Approval Gate. Continue from the highest existing ID.
5. Use the date format YYYY-MM-DD.
6. Set Status to exactly one of: Approved, Rejected, or Deferred.
7. In Related Documents, reference files by their exact manifest names (for example `05-DUAL-VISUAL-SYSTEM.md`, `07-QUALITY-STANDARDS.md`, `08-DESIGN-REVIEW-CHECKLIST.md`).
8. Do not edit or delete a recorded entry. If a decision is superseded, add a new entry that references the earlier Decision ID and change the earlier entry's Status only if it is now Rejected or Deferred.

## Worked Example

The entry below shows a completed record. It matches the example already present in `09-DECISION-LOG.md`.

```
**Date:** 2026-07-12  
**Decision ID:** DEC-001  
**Topic:** Dual Visual System  
**Decision Made:** Palm6 will use two distinct systems. System A (Identity) for logos and official branding, and System B (Marketing) for cinematic and emotional assets.  
**Reasoning:** Prevents the logo from having to carry all emotional weight. Allows a clean, timeless identity while still delivering cinematic marketing.  
**Impact Areas:** Logo design, marketing assets, UI, world-building consistency  
**Status:** Approved  
**Related Documents:** 05-DUAL-VISUAL-SYSTEM.md
```
