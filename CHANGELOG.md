# Changelog - Palm6 (gtarp server)

All notable changes to the Palm6 RP server's custom layer. **This is the
source of truth we post from** — every entry has an internal/technical list for
tracking *and* a ready-to-post **📣 Public** blurb (player-facing, no jargon) for
the Discord `#「📝」updates` channel, the website, and public announcements.

Format: newest first. Dates are EDT.

## 2026-07-13 - Prison economy (`gtarp_yard`)

Jail stops being dead time. Inside Bolingbroke you can now **work to shave your
sentence** and earn commissary cash, buy from a **commissary**, or **post bail**
to walk early (with a catch).

**Tracking (internal):**
- 🆕 **`gtarp_yard`** — three server-authoritative loops on top of the existing
  xt-prison jail: **labor** (`E` at the yard: a task pays a small trickle and
  shaves your sentence), **commissary** (buy-only cash shop), **bail** (pay to
  release early).
- ⛏️ **Labor**: pay ~$75 per ~35s task (deliberately below street earning), each
  task shaves 1 min but the **total shave is capped at 50% of the sentence** so
  jail always costs something. The shave is computed server-side from the
  sentence baseline (never the client) and bound to the live clock, and a
  **persisted** per-character cooldown means relogging can't reset it.
- 🏪 **Commissary**: server-owned prices, a **daily per-item cap** (kills the
  buy-low/resell-high loop), consume-before-grant with a refund ladder.
- ⚖️ **Bail**: superlinear price (short sentences are cheap to skip, long ones
  hurt) with a floor above typical crime payout so it stays a deterrent. Money
  is taken **before** release; if release fails it refunds. Bail is **not a
  clean slate** — it re-issues an `gtarp_mdt` warrant (so `gtarp_bounty`
  auto-posts a contract on the skipper) and stamps a re-arrest cooldown.
- 🔒 Server-authoritative sentence: stored/persisted via xt-prison's own Qbox
  `injail` metadata, keyed to citizenid; disconnect/death/restart never clears
  it; only timer expiry, paid bail, or admin release does. Never trusts a client
  "I'm free" or a client shave/price/amount.
- 🔧 Wiring: `sql/0047` (4 gtarp_-prefixed tables); 3 `gtarp_eventguard` budgets;
  3 ox contraband/commissary items (`yard_pruno`, `yard_commissary_snack`,
  `yard_soap`); self-disables loudly if xt-prison isn't running or an item is
  missing. Bridge-pattern native (§6 clean). **Coords are Bolingbroke Tier-3
  placeholders — VERIFY IN-GAME.** Item PNGs owed (David).

**📣 Public:** Doing time just got real. In prison you can now **work the yard**
to knock time off your sentence and earn commissary money, hit the **commissary**
for supplies, or **post bail** to get out early. But skipping court isn't free:
bail puts a fresh warrant on your head, so bounty hunters and cops get a payday
for bringing you back in.

## 2026-07-13 - Refining tier (`gtarp_market` v2)

The Commodity Exchange gets a value-add tier: turn raw goods into **refined
goods** worth more, at a new **Refinery**.

**Tracking (internal):**
- 🆕 **Refinery** — `E` at the refinery converts raw stacks into refined goods:
  3 `raw_ore` -> `refined_metal`, 2 `animal_pelt` -> `cured_leather`, 2
  `raw_fish` -> `fillet`, 2 `raw_meat` -> `cured_meat`. Instant, lossless-by-
  ratio, integer batches.
- 📈 Refined goods sell **only** at the exchange, priced at ~1.4x
  (raw_base x ratio), and they ride the **same dynamic marginal-crash + recovery
  curve** as raws — so flooding the market with refined goods crashes their price
  faster than it recovers. Self-limiting, no money printer (the exchange is
  sell-only, so there's no round-trip arbitrage).
- 🔒 Instant is safe here because the throttle is the dynamic **sell** side
  (cooldown + marginal crash + per-sale cap), not the conversion: atomic per-
  player refine cooldown before any yield, server-side proximity, consume-before-
  grant with a refund ladder, refinery self-disables if a refined item def is
  missing.
- 🔧 Wiring: 4 new ox items (`refined_metal`, `cured_leather`, `fillet`,
  `cured_meat`); `gtarp_market:refine` eventguard budget; no new SQL table.
  **Refinery coords are a Tier-3 placeholder — VERIFY IN-GAME.** Item PNGs owed.

**📣 Public:** The exchange now has a **Refinery**. Turn your raw ore, pelts,
fish and meat into refined metal, cured leather, fillets and cured meat, then
sell the refined goods for a premium. Just don't flood the market with them, or
the price drops the same way raw goods do.

## 2026-07-13 - Commodity Exchange (`gtarp_market`)

The legal grind gets a real market. A new **Palm6 Commodity Exchange** buys raw
goods (`gtarp_grind` outputs) at a **live price that moves with supply and
demand** instead of a flat vendor rate — and it's the first place you can ever
sell **animal pelts**, which hunting drops but nothing used to buy.

**Tracking (internal):**
- 🆕 **`gtarp_market`** — sell all raw goods (`raw_fish`, `raw_ore`, `raw_meat`,
  `animal_pelt`) at the exchange counter with **E**; check live prices any time
  with **`/market`** (a branded `gtarp_ui` panel).
- 📈 **Dynamic price model, server-authoritative, no client ticks.** Price is a
  pure function of the last persisted `{price, timestamp}` and the current time:
  it recovers toward a rested `base` over wall-clock time and drops per unit
  sold — **marginally within a single sale**, so dumping a big stack crashes the
  price as it sells (no selling 500 units at the top). Floored at `floorPct` of
  base. Restart- and relog-safe, same discipline as the drug grow/dry/cook
  timers.
- 🐟 `raw_fish`/`raw_ore`/`raw_meat` can be sold at *either* their fixed
  `gtarp_grind` buyer (the safe floor, with the grind XP bonus) *or* the
  fluctuating exchange — a genuine sell-now-or-time-it choice. **`animal_pelt`
  is exchange-only** (fixes the confirmed orphan).
- 🔒 Money/dupe-safe: atomic per-player cooldown set before any yield;
  server-side proximity (the client sends no items, amounts or prices);
  consume-before-grant; the market only moves on a completed sale; in-memory
  price set before the DB write so concurrent sellers can't double-dip the top
  price; marginal loop hard-capped.
- 🔧 Wiring: `sql/0046` (`gtarp_market_state` + `gtarp_market_trades`,
  `gtarp_`-prefixed); `gtarp_eventguard` budgets `gtarp_market:sell` (now
  guarding 51 events); `gtarp_economy` shows an informational **clean-cash**
  line via a `GetSummary` export. Bridge-pattern native (§6 gate clean).
  **Exchange coords are a Tier-3 placeholder — VERIFY IN-GAME.** No new items,
  so no PNG debt. Refining tier (`raw_ore→refined_metal`, `pelt→cured_leather`)
  deferred to v2.

**📣 Public:** The city has a **Commodity Exchange**. Fish it, mine it, hunt it,
then bring your raw goods to the exchange and sell at a **price that actually
moves** — flood the market and it drops, let it rest and it climbs back. It's
also the only place to sell **animal pelts**. Sell now, or hold for a better
price. Check the board any time with **/market**.

## 2026-07-11 - Meth cook lab (`gtarp_drugs` §9)

The Schedule I supply chain gets its second drug: **meth**, via a new cook
station. Meth is not a strain (it can never be planted); the cook lab is its
only source. It reuses the same restart-safe, wall-clock, resolve-on-interaction
timer as the drying rack, so there are no client ticks and nothing to dupe on
relog.

**Tracking (internal):**
- 🆕 **Cook station** (3 burners). Load a pseudo stack (its grade sets the
  quality floor) plus acid and red phosphorus; the batch cooks over wall-clock
  time in `gtarp_drugs_processes` (`kind='cook'`, reusing the drying table) and
  mints `meth_raw` crystal on collect.
- 🎲 **Outcome rolled AND stored at start**, never at collect: success (scales
  with rank, capped at 0.9), quality (grade floor, one tier lower on a failed
  cook), yield (config range plus a per-4-ranks bonus, one less on failure), and
  a possible junk effect on a bad batch. Re-collecting can never re-roll a
  better result.
- 🔒 Money/dupe-safe, mirroring grow and dry: precursors consumed before the row
  is written (full refund ladder on any failure), an atomic `running` to
  `collecting` claim so a double-fire can't collect twice, crystal reverted if
  your hands are full, and a per-character concurrent-cook cap. A stranded
  `collecting` row is deleted at boot (err toward loss, never a dupe).
- 🚔 **Cooking is loud**: it warms dealer heat faster than a street sale and has
  a high flat chance to ping police and open a `gtarp_evidence` case the moment
  the burner lights.
- 💊 `meth_raw` and `meth_product` flow through the existing mix, sell and price
  engine automatically (base-agnostic refactor: the base id is `meta.base or
  meta.strain`). Also fixed a latent bug where the street buyer offered meth but
  the sell handler still hardcoded weed items and rejected the sale.
- 🔧 Wiring: 5 ox_inventory items (`pseudo`, `acid`, `red_phosphorus`,
  `meth_raw`, `meth_product`); `gtarp_eventguard` budgets for the 3 cook events;
  a soft boot gate that leaves the lab dark (weed unaffected) until all five
  items are registered. **No new SQL migration** (reuses `gtarp_drugs_processes`).
  Cook coords are a placeholder to verify in-game; item PNGs are still needed
  (David) before icons render.

**📣 Public:** The city has a new product. Set up in the **meth lab**: load your
pseudo, acid and red phosphorus into a burner and let it cook. Higher-grade
pseudo and more experience mean purer crystal and bigger yields, but a sloppy
cook comes out dirty, and cooking is **loud**, so expect the heat. Rank up
through weed to unlock it.

## 2026-07-11 - Gang rename (`gtarp_gangs`)

**Tracking (internal):**
- ➕ `/gang` gains a leader-only **Rename** action: change your gang's name and
  tag for a bank-charged fee (refunded if the change fails). The server
  re-derives leadership from the DB, sanitises and uniqueness-checks the new
  name and tag (excluding your own gang), rejects a no-op before charging, and
  re-mirrors every online member's gang label on success.

**📣 Public:** Gang leaders can now **rename** their crew (name and tag) from the
`/gang` menu for a fee.

---

## 2026-07-10 — Player-run gangs (`gtarp_gangs`)

New custom resource: the **player-created gang layer Qbox does not ship**.
qbx_core owns only the STATIC gang registry (predefined gangs + grades,
`PlayerData.gang`, `/setgang`); this adds what qb-gangs/ps-gangs add to QBCore —
gangs players create and run themselves, membership + ranks, a shared cash
vault, and reputation. The static qbx model is **not** duplicated; it's read
read-only through the bridge, with an opt-in (default-off) mirror seam.

**Tracking (internal):**
- 🆕 **gtarp_gangs** — `/gang` menu. Create (unique name+tag, sanitised/length-
  limited/profanity-filtered, bank-charged founding cost) / disband (leader).
  Membership + ranks (Leader/Officer/Member): invite the closest eligible nearby
  player (server-chosen, never client-named), accept, leave, kick (officer+,
  lower ranks only), promote/demote (leader). **One gang per player** enforced by
  a PK on `citizenid`.
- 💰 **Shared CASH vault** — rank-gated deposit (any member) / withdraw
  (officer+). Deposits are consume-before-credit; withdraws use an **atomic
  guarded decrement** (no double-withdraw race, no overdraft) with rollback on a
  failed payout. Every move logged to `gtarp_gang_vault_log` with a balance
  snapshot. Disband pays the vault remainder back to the leader's bank.
- 📈 **Reputation** — per-gang `rep` + a server-only `AddRep(gangId, amount,
  reason)` export (floors at 0) so turf/protection/drugs can reward gang activity
  later. Exports: `GetGang`, `IsSameGang`, `AddRep`, `GetSummary`.
- 🔒 Server-authoritative throughout (rank/membership/amounts re-checked
  server-side; parameterised SQL; bridge-isolated per GTA6-readiness).
- 🔧 Wiring: `sql/0041_gangs.sql` (3 indexed, restart-safe tables); rate-limit
  budgets in `gtarp_eventguard`; devtest shape + table-map assertions; a `gangs:`
  line on the `/economy` scoreboard; `docs/TESTING.md` §43. (custom.cfg ensure
  line left for the operator — after qbx_core, near the crime resources, after
  `gtarp_eventguard`.)

**📣 Public:** Start your own **crew**. Found a gang with a name and a tag, run
your roster with officer and member ranks, invite people, and pool your money in
a **shared gang vault** only your officers can pull from. Gangs also build a
**reputation** as you run the streets — the foundation for turf and crime payouts
to come. Type `/gang` to get started.

## 2026-07-10 — Economy anti-exploit hardening + coord retune

A server-wide adversarial audit of the money-handling systems (find →
independently verify → fix), plus real-location retuning of placeholder coords
and a continued bridge-pattern rollout. **8 confirmed-exploitable bugs fixed;
the other 12 audited resources came back clean.**

**Tracking (internal):**
- 🔴 **gtarp_courier** — fixed a **critical double-payout race**: `complete` now
  atomically gates the `UPDATE` on `status='taken' AND courier_citizenid` and only
  pays when rows-affected == 1. Same guard on cancel-refund and both lifetime sweeps.
- **gtarp_insurance** — policy is now consumed on claim (one payout per policy);
  no-scene damage claims are hard-denied instead of trusting client health.
- **gtarp_chopshop** — closed a free-money faucet: ambient/NPC cars (no
  `player_vehicles` row, no active stolen report) can no longer be sold.
- **gtarp_bounty** — fixed a city-money faucet: captured state contracts update in
  place (`status IN ('active','claimed')`) instead of re-posting every sweep.
- **gtarp_mechanic** — repairs now require a **customer consent handshake**
  (offer → confirm → accept, re-validated server-side) plus a per-customer cooldown;
  a mechanic can no longer force-charge a non-consenting nearby player.
- 🧩 **Bridge pattern** — extended to `ox_inventory_overrides` (isolated its
  `ox_inventory`/`ox_target`/native calls behind `bridge/`), per GTA6-readiness. The
  other candidate resources already had adapters.
- 📍 **Coord retune** — replaced Tier-3 placeholder map coords with real Los Santos
  locations across bounty, fightclub, gunrunning, laundering, loanshark, numbers,
  protection, and robbery. All flagged `VERIFY IN-GAME`.
- Audited clean (no fixes needed): laundering, numbers, loanshark, protection,
  seizure, smuggling, pumpcoin, economy, ransom, gunrunning, counterfeit, grind.

**📣 Public:**
> 🔧 **Server maintenance — economy hardening**
> We ran a full security sweep of the crime economy and patched several money
> exploits (courier payouts, insurance claims, chop-shop, bounties). Repairs from
> mechanics now ask for your approval before charging you. Plus we moved a bunch of
> racket locations to their real spots around the city. Cleaner, fairer hustle. 💰

## 2026-07-10 — 🌿 New: `gtarp_drugs` (Schedule I-style) — MVP Phase 1 built

The missing drug supply chain — a faithful adaptation of **Schedule I**. Design
locked in `docs/DRUGS-SPEC.md`; **MVP (weed only) built**: grow → mix a custom
branded product with stacking effects + quality → sell → dirty cash → laundering
+ heat/evidence. Not yet wired into `custom.cfg` (operator step).

**Tracking (internal):**
- 🌱 **Grow loop** — buy `weed_seed` + `soil` (+ optional grow additive), plant at
  an ox_target grow plot, water over **wall-clock DB timers resolved on
  interaction** (restart-safe, no client ticks), harvest `weed_bud` with
  `{strain,quality,effects,dried}` metadata. Neglect (water → 0%) drops quality/yield.
- 🌬️ **Drying rack → Heavenly** — hang a stack of fresh `weed_bud` on the rack
  (ox_target) to dry it over a **wall-clock `gtarp_drugs_processes` timer** (`kind='dry'`,
  epoch seconds, resolved on interaction like the grow timers). On collect the buds
  come back **bumped to Heavenly (tier 4, ×1.30)** with `dried=true`, and the price
  engine applies the markup on any later mix/sell. One run per rack slot (UNIQUE
  `(kind,station_id)`); server-owned by its starter; **atomic `running→collecting`
  collect claim**; a crash-stranded run reverts to `running` at boot (never lost).
  No new item — the rack is a world station.
- 🧪 **Mixing station** — pick a base stack + one additive; the **server** resolves
  effects (**reactions first, then append-if-absent, 8-cap, order kept**), recomputes
  quality + unit price via the spec §5 formula, sanitizes a player brand, mints one
  `weed_product` (`{brand,base,effects[],quality,unit_value,batch_id,producer}`).
  Bad-mix roll can inflict a junk effect. Named recipes saved to `gtarp_drugs_recipes` for
  one-click repeat.
- ⚗️ **Effect reaction/transform system** — the signature Schedule I mechanic:
  mixing now **transforms** existing effects into other (often higher-value) ones
  when an additive reacts with them, so the result is **order-dependent**
  (`Cuke→Banana` ≠ `Banana→Cuke`). `Config.Reactions` (112 real reaction rules
  across all 16 additives, cross-checked 2026-07-10 against the Schedule 1 Fandom
  wiki + Steam "Complete Mixing Database" / "Full Transformation Guide" + calculator
  charts) is the tuning surface; deterministic, server-side (`reactEffects` in
  `doMix`), 8-cap preserved. Retune vs the live mixing DB as the game patches it.
- 💵 **Selling** — real players via ox_inventory trade, plus one **rate-limited NPC
  street-buyer** paying DIRTY `black_money` priced from the item's real metadata,
  bounded by a **per-character daily faucet cap**. Logged to `gtarp_drugs_sales`.
- 🚔 **Heat/evidence (basic)** — sales warm a per-dealer heat model; a hot dealer or
  witness roll (and the odd big harvest) trips a native police alert +
  `gtarp_evidence` case. Every unit carries `batch_id`+`producer` for audit.
- 🧱 **Full §1–5 config** — 4 weed strains, 16 additives→effects, all 34 effect
  multipliers, 5 quality tiers, and the server-authoritative `Config.Price` helper.
- 🛡️ **Server-authoritative** — never trusts client price/effects/quality/amount;
  recomputes from config + metadata; consumes inputs before granting outputs;
  proximity re-derived server-side; all SQL parameterized. 12 net events registered
  in `gtarp_eventguard`. New items added to `ox_inventory_overrides` (replacing the
  earlier generic `cannabis_leaf`/`weed_baggie` draft). SQL: `gtarp_drugs_plants`,
  `gtarp_drugs_recipes`, `gtarp_drugs_progression`, `gtarp_drugs_sales` (`sql/0039_drugs.sql`) +
  `gtarp_drugs_processes` (the drying-rack timer, `sql/0040_drugs_drying.sql`).
- ⏭️ **Deferred to Phase 2/3:** meth/shrooms/coke, NPC customers + hired dealers,
  and rank/XP-gated properties.

**📣 Public:**
> 🌿 **New hustle incoming — grow, cook, and brand your own product**
> Plant strains, keep them watered, then take your buds to the mixing bench and
> cut them with additives to build custom effects and quality — then slap your own
> brand on it. Better product, better payout. Sell to other players or move it fast
> to a street buyer for dirty cash you'll need to launder. Bring heat if you get
> greedy. 💨
